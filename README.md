# Decentralized Note-taking App

## Introduction
The Decentralized Note-taking App is a secure and collaborative platform built on the Aptos blockchain. This application allows users to create, update, and delete notes, with each note being stored on the decentralized network.

## Vision
The vision for this project is to provide a decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative to traditional note-taking applications. By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, we aim to ensure that users' notes are stored securely and privately, without the risk of data being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties.

## Future Goals
- Implement access control and sharing features, allowing users to selectively share their notes with others.
- Integrate with other decentralized services, such as decentralized storage or messaging platforms, to enhance the overall user experience.
- Develop a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for both technical and non-technical users to manage their notes.
- Explore the integration of advanced features, such as versioning, search, and collaboration tools, to further improve the note-taking experience.
